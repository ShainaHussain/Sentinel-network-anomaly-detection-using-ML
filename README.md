# Sentinel-network-anomaly-detection-using-ML
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to detect unusual patterns or suspicious activities within a network that may indicate potential security threats. The system analyzes network traffic data and distinguishes between normal and anomalous behavior using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
